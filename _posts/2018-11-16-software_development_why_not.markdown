 I don't know that my decision to go into software development can be traced back to any one reason.  I think there were several small moments that lead up to this transformative decision to make a career change after happily working in education for over ten years.

I wish there was some magical, epic epiphony that involved unicorns and rainbows leading me to become a software developer, but it was more of a practical, organic move.  Watching the world around me change so quickly and knowing that there were things I could learn and create that didn't exist got the gears moving and synapses firing.  I wanted to be part of this innovation and rapidly changing tech world.  

Within the classroom walls, I saw how technology transformed my student's learning experiences, and I never looked back.  I immersed myself in any opportunity to become involved in educational technology from conferences, to trying new software platforms out as an alternative to traditional projects and assignments with my students.  Working with technology and computer science with my students made me feel alive, confident, hopeful, and excited about the future of education.

I went on to become an instructional designer and eduational techology coach for a computer science immersion company called Code To The Future.  Essentially, this opened my world to endless possibilities, and I will forever be thankful for this opportunity.  Throughout my experience with Code To The Future, I realized something.  I was pretty good at coding!  Okay, maybe in the beginning stages it was just connecting a bunch of blocks together to make a character move around on screen, but eventually it morphed into Minecraft Modding and developing curriculum for text-based programming.

Which leads me to here, I'm doing this.  I'm taking baby steps, but I'm one hundred percent getting there.  More women programmers, we need them.  I have 8 more months to go, but I'll get there, and feel hopeful unicorns and rainbows will await me as I completed this program and become a full-stack web developer.
